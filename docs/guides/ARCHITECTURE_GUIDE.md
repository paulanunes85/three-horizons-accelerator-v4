## 2. Understanding the Three Horizons Model

### 2.1 What is the Three Horizons Framework?

> 💡 **Origin of the Model**
>
> The Three Horizons Accelerator is a solution created in partnership with **Microsoft**,
> **GitHub**, and **Red Hat**. It helps organizations balance maintaining current operations
> (H1) while developing improvements (H2) and exploring future opportunities (H3).

The Three Horizons model organizes the platform into three layers with different purposes:

![Three Horizons Framework](../assets/arch-three-horizons-framework.svg)

### 2.2 Why Use Three Horizons?

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Clear Dependencies** | Each horizon has well-defined dependencies on lower horizons |
| **Independent Scaling** | Horizons can evolve at different speeds |
| **Risk Isolation** | Experimental H3 features don't affect stable H1 infrastructure |
| **Incremental Adoption** | Organizations can start with H1, add H2/H3 when ready |
| **Budget Control** | Each horizon can have separate cost allocation |

## 3. High-Level Platform Architecture

### 3.1 Layered Architecture Diagram

![Layered Platform Architecture](../assets/arch-layered-architecture.svg)

### 3.2 Design Principles

> 💡 **What are Design Principles?**
>
> Design principles are the rules we follow when making architecture decisions.
> They ensure consistency and help avoid common mistakes.

| Principle | What It Means | How We Implement It |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Infrastructure as Code** | All infrastructure is defined in code, not created manually | Terraform for Azure resources, Kubernetes manifests for apps |
| **GitOps** | Git is the single source of truth for deployments | ArgoCD watches Git repos and syncs changes automatically |
| **Zero Trust** | Never trust, always verify | Private endpoints, workload identity, network policies |
| **Immutable Infrastructure** | Don't modify running systems; replace them | Rolling updates, blue-green deployments |
| **Observable** | Everything can be measured and monitored | Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, alerts |
| **Self-Service** | Developers can deploy without ops intervention | Golden Path templates, RHDH portal |
| **Policy as Code** | Security policies are defined in code | Gatekeeper/OPA constraints |
| **Cost Awareness** | Monitor and optimize costs continuously | Azure Cost Management, budgets, alerts |

---

## 4. Infrastructure Architecture

### 4.1 AKS Cluster Architecture

> 💡 **What is AKS?**
>
> Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service. Azure manages
> the control plane (API server, etcd, scheduler), and you only manage the
> worker nodes where your applications run.

![AKS Cluster Architecture](../assets/arch-aks-cluster.svg)

### 4.2 Why Multiple Node Pools?

| Node Pool | Purpose | Why Separate? |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **System** | Kubernetes system components | Isolates system pods from application disruptions |
| **Workload** | Application pods | Can scale independently based on app demand |
| **AI** | GPU-accelerated workloads | Expensive GPUs only used when needed (scales to 0) |

### 4.3 Cluster Add-ons

These are additional capabilities we enable on the AKS cluster:

| Add-on | What It Does | Why We Enable It |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Azure CNI** | Network plugin | Assigns Azure VNet IPs to pods for better network integration |
| **Azure Policy** | Policy enforcement | Integrates with Azure Policy for compliance |
| **Workload Identity** | Pod authentication | Allows pods to authenticate to Azure without secrets |
| **Key Vault CSI** | Secret injection | Mounts Key Vault secrets as files in pods |
| **Blob CSI** | Blob storage | Allows pods to use Azure Blob storage as volumes |

---

## 5. Network Architecture

### 5.1 Network Topology

> 💡 **Why Network Architecture Matters**
>
> Proper network design is critical for:
> - **Security:** Isolating sensitive workloads
> - **Performance:** Reducing latency between components
> - **Compliance:** Meeting regulatory requirements for data isolation

![Network Topology](../assets/arch-network-topology.svg)

### 5.2 Private DNS Zones

> 💡 **What are Private DNS Zones?**
>
> When you create a private endpoint for an Azure service (like Key Vault),
> it gets a private IP (e.g., 10.0.4.5). Private DNS zones automatically
> resolve the service's public DNS name to this private IP when queried
> from within the VNet.

| Service | Private DNS Zone | Example Resolution |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Key Vault | `privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net` | kv-myapp.vault.azure.net → 10.0.4.5 |
| ACR | `privatelink.azurecr.io` | myacr.azurecr.io → 10.0.4.4 |
| PostgreSQL | `privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com` | mydb.postgres.database.azure.com → 10.0.4.6 |
| OpenAI | `privatelink.openai.azure.com` | myoai.openai.azure.com → 10.0.4.7 |

### 5.3 Network Security Groups (NSGs)

NSGs act as firewalls at the subnet level:

## 7. GitOps Architecture

### 7.1 What is GitOps?

> 💡 **GitOps Explained Simply**
>
> GitOps means **Git is the source of truth** for your infrastructure.
> Instead of running commands to deploy, you commit changes to Git,
> and a tool (ArgoCD) automatically applies them to your cluster.

### 7.2 GitOps Workflow

![GitOps Workflow](../assets/arch-gitops-workflow.svg)

### 7.3 ArgoCD Application Model

![ArgoCD Application Hierarchy](../assets/arch-argocd-app-model.svg)

### 7.4 Sync Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use | How It Works |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Auto-Sync** | Development environments | ArgoCD automatically applies changes when Git changes |
| **Manual Sync** | Production | Human must click "Sync" to apply changes |
| **Self-Heal** | Always-on environments | ArgoCD reverts manual changes made directly to cluster |
| **Prune** | Cleanup needed | Deletes resources removed from Git |

---

## 8. Observability Architecture

### 8.1 Observability Stack

> 💡 **What is Observability?**
>
> Observability is the ability to understand what's happening inside your system
> by looking at its external outputs: **metrics**, **logs**, and **traces**.

## 12. Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: Use AKS Instead of Self-Managed Kubernetes

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** We need a Kubernetes platform for container orchestration.

**Decision:** Use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) instead of self-managed Kubernetes.

**Rationale:**
- Azure manages the control plane (99.95% SLA)
- Automatic security patches
- Deep Azure integration (identity, networking, storage)
- Lower operational overhead
- Cost: Only pay for worker nodes

**Trade-offs:**
- Less control over control plane configuration
- Tied to Azure's upgrade schedule

---

### ADR-002: Use ArgoCD for GitOps

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** We need a mechanism to deploy applications declaratively.

**Decision:** Use ArgoCD for GitOps-based deployments.

**Rationale:**
- CNCF graduated project (mature, well-maintained)
- Excellent UI for visibility
- Supports Helm, Kustomize, plain YAML
- Application-centric model fits our needs
- Strong community support

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Flux: Good but less intuitive UI
- Jenkins X: More complex, heavier
- Spinnaker: Enterprise-focused, complex

---

### ADR-003: Use Azure CNI Networking

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need to choose Kubernetes network plugin.

**Decision:** Use Azure CNI instead of kubenet.

**Rationale:**
- Pods get VNet IP addresses directly
- Better integration with Azure services
- Required for some features (Windows nodes, network policies)
- Better performance for large clusters

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires more IP addresses (need larger subnets)
- More complex IP planning

---

### ADR-004: Use External Secrets Operator

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Applications need access to secrets stored in Key Vault.

**Decision:** Use External Secrets Operator instead of Key Vault CSI driver.

**Rationale:**
- Works with standard Kubernetes Secrets (no application changes)
- Supports multiple secret stores (flexibility)
- Automatic refresh of secrets
- Better GitOps compatibility

**Trade-offs:**
- Additional component to maintain
- Secrets exist in-cluster (encrypted at rest)
