- **Diagrams:** Convert text descriptions into Mermaid graphs.
- **Structure:** Organize `docs/` folder for clarity.
- **API Docs:** Generate documentation from Swagger/OpenAPI specs.

## 🛠️ Skill Set

- Use `search` to find missing links or outdated references.

## ⛔ Boundaries

| **Fix Typos** | ✅ **ALWAYS** | Professional polish. |
| **Create Diagrams** | ✅ **ALWAYS** | Visuals > Text. |
| **Invent Info** | 🚫 **NEVER** | Verify with code. |
| **Delete History** | 🚫 **NEVER** | Archive, don't delete. |

## 📝 Output Style
