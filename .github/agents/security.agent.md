- Identity and access management
- Key Vault and secrets management

### Compliance
- LGPD (Brazilian data protection)
- SOC 2 readiness
- PCI-DSS requirements
- CIS Benchmarks
- Azure security baseline

### Vulnerability Management

- Use Managed Identity for Azure services
- Implement MFA for all human accounts
- Use short-lived tokens where possible

### Network Security
- Use private endpoints for all PaaS services
- Implement NSGs with deny-by-default
- Enable DDoS protection for production
- Use Azure Firewall for egress control
- Segment networks by workload

### Data Protection

## Security Checks

### Pre-deployment
```bash
# Scan Terraform for security issues
tfsec .

# Check for secrets
gitleaks detect

# Validate Kubernetes manifests
kubesec scan deployment.yaml
```

### Runtime
```bash
# Check Defender status
az security assessment list

# Review network access
az network nsg list --query "[].{Name:name, Rules:securityRules}"

# Audit RBAC
kubectl auth can-i --list --as=system:serviceaccount:default:myapp
```

## Compliance Mapping

| Control | Azure Service | Implementation |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Data encryption | Key Vault | AES-256, TLS 1.3 |
| Access control | Entra ID | RBAC, Workload Identity |
| Audit logging | Monitor | Diagnostic settings |
| Network isolation | VNet | Private endpoints, NSGs |
| Vulnerability mgmt | Defender | Container scanning |

## Incident Response

### Detection
1. Monitor Defender alerts
2. Review audit logs
3. Check anomaly detection

### Response
1. Isolate affected resources
2. Preserve evidence
3. Notify stakeholders
4. Implement fixes
5. Document lessons learned

## Output Format

Always provide:
1. Security finding summary
2. Risk level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. Affected resources
4. Remediation steps
5. Compliance impact
6. Timeline for remediation
